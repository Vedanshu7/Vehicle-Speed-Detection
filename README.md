Introduction
  
   Vehicle Speed Detection is a Python Script to track and detect the speed of a moving vehicle. This script can automatically detect the lane in the highway and split the output based on each lane and automatically capture the image of an over-speeding vehicle. Through this Application the Camera detects the speed of vehicle and if it is over-speeding we can come to know. So we can digitally catch the vehicles easily.
